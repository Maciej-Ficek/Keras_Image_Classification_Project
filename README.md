# Keras_Image_Classification_Project
My project classifies the images in the single-etiquette multi-class classification problem from here: https://github.com/ardamavi/Sign-Language-Digits-Dataset

That code classifies the images using the neural networks from Keras. I also add here requirements.txt with librariers to install, as well as best model.

Supervised Learning

I add here three models - main one is the best one with RMSprop optimizer. I also tested Adam and SGD.
You can also see plots of the accuracy of these three models.

Before running my code, install the libraries with:

python -m pip install --upgrade pip

pip install -r requirements.txt

and adjust the paths to the training and test images.
